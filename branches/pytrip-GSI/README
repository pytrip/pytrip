--- WHAT IS THIS ? ---

PyTRiP is a python package for working with TRiP and VIRTUOS/VOXELPLAN files.
It is mainly supposed for batch processing, but an experimental GUI is also included.


--- HOW TO DO STUFF ---


from pytrip import *

# read a dose cube, divide by 2.0, and write to a new cube:
d0 = DosCube()
d0.read("box050001.dos")
d0 = d0/2.0
d0.write("out0.dos")

# sum two dose cubes, write result:
print "Two half boxes: out.dos"
d1 = DosCube()
d2 = DosCube()
d1.read("box052000.dos")
d2.read("box053000.dos")
d = (d1 + d2)
d.write("out.dos")


# print minium and maximum value found in cubes
print d1.cube.min(),d1.cube.max()
print d0.cube.min(),d0.cube.max()

# calculate new dose average LET cube
l1 = LETCube()
l2 = LETCube()
l1.read("box052000.dosemlet.dos")
l2.read("box053000.dosemlet.dos")

l = ((d1 * l1) + (d2 * l2)) / (d1 + d2)
l.write("out.dosemlet.dos")


--- WHAT ELSE CAN I DO ? ---

Any object has a lot of methods, documentation is still poor.
But use dir(<object>) and help(<object>) commands.

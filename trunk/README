--- WHAT IS THIS ? ---

PyTRiP is a python package for working with TRiP and VIRTUOS/VOXELPLAN files.
It is mainly supposed for batch processing, but an experimental GUI is also included.

--- REQUIREMENTS --- 

PyTrip is developed on Debain Squeeze (6.0). 

* python2.5 or better
* python-dev
* python-matplotlib (and all its dependencies, such as numpy)
* python-gtk2
* python-glade2

all these packages are available in the standard Debian repository. There may be more packages, please let me know.

Optional package:

* pydicom

whithout it, you wont be able to load any DICOM files, so I highly recommend you install it. Pydicom is not a part of the Debian repository. Get it from: 
http://code.google.com/p/pydicom/


--- INSTALLATION ---

Unzip the tar-ball and run as root user:

     python ./setup.py install

--- HOW TO DO STUFF ---

* start the GUI:

  gtrip

there are plenty of testfiles in the "testfiles" directory.


* From the python console, or run it as a script:

from pytrip import *

# read a dose cube, divide by 2.0, and write to a new cube:
d0 = DoseCube("box050001.dos")
d0 = d0/2.0
d0.write("out0.dos")

# sum two dose cubes, write result:
print "Two half boxes: out.dos"
d1 = DoseCube("box052000.dos")
d2 = DoseCube("box053000.dos")
d = (d1 + d2)
d.write("out.dos")


# print minium and maximum value found in cubes
print d1.cube.min(),d1.cube.max()
print d0.cube.min(),d0.cube.max()

# calculate new dose average LET cube
l1 = DoseCube("box052000.dosemlet.dos")
l2 = DoseCube("box053000.dosemlet.dos")

l = ((d1 * l1) + (d2 * l2)) / (d1 + d2)
l.write("out.dosemlet.dos")

# plot the LET distribution of slice X = 115:
l.plot("x",115,"myplot.png")

#print l.cube.min(),l.cube.max()


--- WHAT ELSE CAN I DO ? ---

Any object has a lot of methods, documentation is still poor.
But use dir(<object>) and help(<object>) commands.
